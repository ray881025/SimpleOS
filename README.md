# SimpleOS 🖥️

**SimpleOS** is a lightweight operating system simulation written in C. It provides a command-line interface that mimics basic file system operations, designed as an educational tool for learning core OS concepts such as file management, directory navigation, and permissions.

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 File Operations: `create`, `read`, `write`, `rename`, `delete`, `copy`, `move`
- 📂 Directory Management: `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `cd`, `ls`
- 🔒 Permission Handling: `chmod` with Unix-style permissions (read, write, execute)
- ❓ Built-in Help: `help` command shows all supported actions
- 📍 Interactive CLI: prompt reflects current working directory

## 🧠 Purpose

This project was developed to deepen understanding of operating system design and file systems, without the complexity of real OS kernels. It uses in-memory data structures to simulate hierarchical storage and user interactions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
